        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy recipe for the great french pancakes is a good choice
            for a nice morning breakfast or an afternoon snack. It is quite 
            simple so you can even try to make it with your kids. If you have 
            any. If you don't have children, just enjoy your time alone, 
            cooking is a good way to relax and to be in the present moment. Lol. 
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is done for cca 10 pancakes, the number depends on the size of your
        frying pan and the amount of dough you will pour. </p>
         
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk and possibly more</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>oil or butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl mix all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It's best to start with the dry stuff and then add 
                the liquid bit by bit. Don't put in any butter or oil. 
                Those are for frying.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure the dough is not too liquid or too tough. 
                Too liquid means your pancakes will tear to pieces.
                Too tough means the pancakes won't be so soft. 
            </li>
            <li>Turn the heat on (medium) and grease the pan with some oil or butter.</li>
            <li>Pour into your pan one soup ladle of the dough. Just enough to 
                cover all the bottom. It might be a little less or a little more.
                Depends on the sizes of your instruments. 
            </li>
            <li>Wait for about a minute, check by yourself if the first side is fried enough, 
                then turn the pancake upside down. You can try the flip in the aire if you 
                are brave and fast enough. Although I don't recomend this to you if you are a child 
                or if your frying pan is too heavy.
            </li>
            <li>Take the pancake out when you see it ready to go. You can add sweet or salty, 
                as you like.
            </li>
            <li>Tips on what you can put on your pancake: sugar, jam, cream, chocolate, cheese, 
                cheese and ham, cheese and egg, peanut butter,...
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy your chef time and be careful with the fire. If it's the kids who make the pancakes, 
                teach them about all the dangers they could possibly encounter. For 20 first times they 
                make the pancakes, stay behind their backs. You never know.</li>
        </ol>
