        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Eggs are easy to boil, yet so many of us fail 
            to boil them just enough and not too much.
            For this recipe you will need only three ingredients.
            This recipe is very easy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>eggs (How many do you want to eat?)</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the eggs in a cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Fill the rest of the pot with cold water.</li>
            <li>Add some salt in the water so they won't crack. 
                Well, they may crack anyway. But that's OK.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat on.</li>
            <li>When the water starts boiling, count the minutes 
                to have the eggs boiled as much as you want.
                For softly boiled eggs you will need 4 minutes.
                For hard eggs you will need 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are boiled enough put them in
                 cold water so you can peel them after easily.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your chef time and be careful with the fire 
                and the hot water. You never know.</li>
        </ol>
